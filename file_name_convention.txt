Naming convention for data files for compatibility with plotting scripts

Updated (as of): 2023 07 17

Naming: {transmitter}_{receiver}_{port}_{plane}_{angle}(_{scope channel}.csv)
The portion in parenthesis is filled in by the scope automatically.

If pulser data: {device}_{"pulser"/"pulse"}_{optional descriptor}_{trial} (_{scope channel}.csv)
device = fid, avtech
Optional descriptor = examples: 1CABLE, 2CABLES, or the date

Transmitter, Receiver:
- "UCLA" = UCLA calibrated horn
- "UCHI" = UChicago calibrated horn
- "R1A" = RFSpin Antenna 1 Port A
- "R2B" = RFSpin Antenna 2 Port B
- etc.
- "T1A" = Toyon Antenna 1 Port A
- etc.

Port:
- A or B (on the Receiving antenna)

Plane:
Note: the physical set up does not allow 360 deg rotation in elevation, hence all rotations are in the plane parallel to the ground. This forces the swept planes to be dependent on the polarization of the transmitter.
- E if transmitter is horizontally polarized (Defintion: the main port's swept plane is parallel to polarization of transmitter)
- H if the transmitter is vertically polarized (Definition: the main port's swept plane is perpendicular to the polarization of the transmitter)

Angle:
- Integer only
- For negative angles, use "NEG", i.e. NEG30

Note:
Both ports are fed into the oscilloscope during measurement. The reported port in the filename is the port which matches the transmitter polarization and this data is fed into Ch1 of the scope. The perpedicular port is fed into Ch2. Therefore, Ch2 is the XPol measurement.
Ch3 is the signal from the function generator which is used to trigger the scope and the pulser.
