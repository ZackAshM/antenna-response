Naming convention for data files for compatibility with plotting scripts

Updated (as of): 2022 08 29

Naming: {transmitter}_to_{receiver}_{polarization}_{optional descriptor}_{angle}_{trial} (_{scope channel}.csv)
The portion in parenthesis is filled in by the scope automatically.

If pulser data: {DEVICE}_PULSE_{optional descriptor}_{trial} (_{scope channel}.csv)
DEVICE = AVTECH, FID
Optional descriptor = examples: 1CABLE, 2CABLES, or the date

Transmitter, Receiver:
- "UCLA" = UCLA calibrated horn
- "R1A" = RFSpin Antenna 1 Port A
- "R2B" = RFSpin Antenna 2 Port B
- etc.
- "T1A" = Toyon Antenna 1 Port A
- etc.

Polarizations:
- "HPOL" = receiver and transmitter connected to horizontal port
- "VPOL" = receiver and transmitter connected to vertical port
- "XPOL" = cross pol measurement; receiver and transmitter pols perpendicular [Not needed if separated by scope channel, i.e. if measured same time as other port]

Optional Descriptors: (examples)
- "NOFOAM" = no foam
- "LONGFOAM" = only long boxes of foam used (aka partial foam coverage)
- "FULLFOAM" = all boxes of foam used ('full' coverage)
- "VTILT" or "ZE" = Vertical Tilt / Zenith / Antenna pitch angles

Angle:
- Integer only
- For negative angles, use "NEG"

Trial:
- For record keeping multiple takes
- Move 'bad' trials out of the data directory

Note on Plane:
E = rotation plane is perpendicular to the polarization
H = rotation plane is parallel to the polarization
Currently (2022 08 22), the horns get rotated to take both planes. For this reason, "HPOL" refers to an E-Plane measurement in Ch1, and "VPOL" refers to an H-Plane measurement in Ch1. Ch2 will refer to the XPOL.
